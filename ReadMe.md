# Marvel API 

This project demonstrates how to use JSON requests asynchronously. The project uses jquery for JSON requests, Async.JS to load those requests in seqential order, Jquery-UI for autocomplete functionality, with Bootstrap and Angular on the front end.

If you would like to demo the project, follow these steps in your terminal:

```
$git clone https://github.com/jeremygholland/marvelAPI.git
$cd marvelAPI
$python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

From there, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/ajax.html

Thanks for looking!
